CryptoMiniSat SAT solver
===========================================

This system provides CryptoMiniSat, an advanced SAT solver. The system has 3
interfaces: command-line, C++ library and python. The command-line interface
takes a [cnf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunctive_normal_form) as an
input in the [DIMACS](http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html)
format with the extension of XOR clauses. The C++ interface mimics this except
that it allows for a more efficient system, with assumptions and multiple
`solve()` calls. The python system is an interface to the C++ system that
provides the best of both words: ease of use and a powerful interface.

Prerequisites
-----

You need to have the following installed in case you use Debian or Ubuntu -- for
other distros, the packages should be similarly named::
```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake
```

The following are not required but are useful::
```
$ sudo apt-get install valgrind libm4ri-dev libmysqlclient-dev libsqlite3-dev
```

Compiling and installing
-----

You have to use cmake to compile and install. I suggest::
```
$ tar xzvf my-cryptominisat-tarball.tar.gz
$ cd cryptominisat-version
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

Once cryptominisat is installed, the binary is available under
`/usr/local/bin/cryptominisat4`, the library shared library is available
under `/usr/local/lib/libcryptominisat4.so` and the 3 header files are
available under `/usr/local/include/cryptominisat4/`. To use the python
bindings, you must have python installed while compiling and after the
compilation has finished, issue:

```
$ sudo ldconfig
```

You can uninstall both by simply doing `sudo make uninstall` in their respective
directories.

Command-line usage
-----

Let's take the file::
```
p cnf 2 3
1 0
-2 0
-1 2 3 0
```

The files has 3 clauses and 2 variables, this is reflected in the header
`p cnf 2 3`. Every clause is ended by '0'. The clauses say: 1 must be True, 2
must be False, and either 1 has to be False, 2 has to be True or 3 has to be
True. The only solution to this problem is::
```
$ cryptominisat --verb 0 file.cnf
s SATISFIABLE
v 1 -2 3 0
```

If the file had contained::
```
p cnf 2 4
1 0
-2 0
-3 0
-1 2 3 0
```

Then there is no solution and the solver returns `s UNSATISFIABLE`.

Python usage
-----

The python module is under the directory `python`. You have to first compile
and install this module, as explained above. You can then use it as::

```
>>> from pycryptosat import Solver
>>> s = Solver()
>>> s.add_clause([1])
>>> s.add_clause([-2])
>>> s.add_clause([3])
>>> s.add_clause([-1, 2, 3])
>>> sat, solution = s.solve()
>>> print sat
True
>>> print solution
(None, True, False, True)
```

We can also try to assume any variable values for a single solver run::
```
>>> sat, solution = s.solve([-3])
>>> print sat
False
>>> print solution
None
>>> sat, solution = s.solve()
>>> print sat
True
>>> print solution
(None, True, False, True)
```

For more detailed instruction, please see the README.rst under the `python`
directory.

Library usage
-----
The library uses a variable numbering scheme that starts from 0. Since 0 cannot
be negated, the class `Lit` is used as: `Lit(variable_number, is_negated)`. As
such, the 1st CNF above would become::

```
#include <cryptominisat4/cryptominisat.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <vector>
using std::vector;
using namespace CMSat;

int main()
{
    SATSolver solver;
    vector<Lit> clause;

    //We need 3 variables
    solver.new_vars(3);

    //Let's use 4 threads
    solver.set_num_threads(4);

    //adds "1 0"
    clause.push_back(Lit(0, false));
    solver.add_clause(clause);

    //adds "-2 0"
    clause.clear();
    clause.push_back(Lit(1, true));
    solver.add_clause(clause);

    //adds "-1 2 3 0"
    clause.clear();
    clause.push_back(Lit(0, true));
    clause.push_back(Lit(1, false));
    clause.push_back(Lit(2, false));
    solver.add_clause(clause);

    lbool ret = solver.solve();
    assert(ret == l_True);
    assert(solver.get_model()[0] == l_True);
    assert(solver.get_model()[1] == l_False);
    assert(solver.get_model()[2] == l_True);
    std::cout
    << "Solution is: "
    << solver.get_model()[0]
    << ", " << solver.get_model()[1]
    << ", " << solver.get_model()[2]
    << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

The library usage also allows for assumptions. We can add these lines just
before the `return 0;` above::
```
vector<Lit> assumptions;
assumptions.push_back(Lit(2, true));
lbool ret = solver.solve(assumptions);
assert(ret == l_False);

lbool ret = solver.solve();
assert(ret == l_True);
```

Since we assume that variabe 2 must be false, there is no solution. However,
if we solve again, without the assumption, we get back the original solution.
Assumptions allow us to assume certain literal values for a _specific run_ but
not all runs -- for all runs, we can simply add these assumptions as 1-long
clauses.
